# panel

## *panel size*

Unfortunately, unlike the elements mentioned above, the size of panels are not certain. 

The unit of the viewport of the panels are `1NULL`, which means the size of the panels only calculate after the plot is drawn.

They're determined by the size of the window you open or the device you save graphics.

You cannot control the size of panels by setting `theme`.

``` {r, fig.align='center', out.width = "60%", fig.width = 10, fig.height = 10}
gt <- ggplotGrob(p)
layout <- gtable:::gtable_layout(gt)
grid:::grid.show.layout(layout)
```


## panel.spacing

But you can control the gap between each panels.

```{r, panel.1, eval = FALSE}
p + theme(
      panel.spacing = unit(1, "line"),
#     panel.spacing.x = NULL,
#     panel.spacing.y = NULL
    )
```
``` {r, echo = FALSE}
pl <- {
  <<panel.1>>
}
wh <- findWH(pl, unit = "in", is.legend.overlap = TRUE, is.square = TRUE)
```
```{r, fig.dim = wh, echo = FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width = "60%"}
pl
```
